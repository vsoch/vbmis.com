<h2>Impairments of Theory of Mind disrupt patterns of brain activity (11 subjects)</h2>
Investigators:	Rebecca Saxe (Owner: Saxe, Rebecca)
Description:	Humans think constantly about one another¿s thoughts, for example, in order to communicate, to teach, to learn from, to cooperate with, to compete with, and to deceive one another. This ability to fluently infer what others are thinking is impaired in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), but the neural basis of this impairment is poorly understood. In particular, brain regions involved in thinking about other people¿s thoughts are not reliably smaller or less active in individuals with ASD. This proposal will test the possibility that it is not reduced magnitude of activity, but disorganization of the pattern of activity, in these brain regions which leads to social impairments in ASD. We will test these two hypotheses about the function of ToM regions in adults with ASD, in three key areas of ToM: understanding others¿ thoughts that are relevant for moral judgments (e.g. intentional vs accidental harm), for inferring emotions, and for effective communication. Since ASD is a developmental disorder, it is critical to understand the developmental trajectory of these brain regions as well as their end state. Consequently, we will also test these hypotheses in children aged 5-12 years. We will also test whether the selectivity or pattern of activation in ToM brain regions changes over development. more

<h2>Genomic Profiling and Functional Mutation Analysis in Autism Spectrum Disorders (1 subjects)</h2>
Investigators:	Matthew State (Owner: Navidi, Gretchen)
Description:	This proposal is in response to a request for applications to address "Genomic Profiling of Mental Disorders", and proposes intensive genomic profiling and functional analysis of Contactin Associated Protein 2 (CNTNAP2) as well as the presynaptic cytomatrix protein Piccolo (PCLO), in an effort to clarify their roles in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In addition, the application proposes to deeply sequence genes in the Contactin and Contactin Associated pathways, as well as genes coding for proteins known to interact with PCLO.
