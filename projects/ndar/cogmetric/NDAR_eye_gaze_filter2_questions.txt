notes:  0 = Exhibits appropriate integration of eye contact and at least one behavior (e.g., vocalization, gesture, or handing an object to the examiner or the parent/caregiver) to request bubbles, the remote-controlled toy animal, object routine, or social routine. Must include eye contact and a definite indication of wanting the other person to do or give something (e.g., by persisting in the request if the other person pauses before responding). This does not include physically pulling or placing the examiner's hand on an object or to the child himself or herself. 1 = Uses one or more behavior(s) listed above to request the remote-controlled toy animal, bubbles, and/or a routine, without integrating eye contact and other behavior(s), such as vocalization or gesture. This includes handing an object to the examiner or parent/caregiver without looking at him or her, looking at the other person without another behavior, and brief requests without persistence. It does not include physically pulling the examiner's hand to an object or to himself or herself. 2 = Does not directly request, as specified above for ratings of 0 or 1, but uses some physical  means to request at least one action as part of a routine (e.g., pulls the examiner's hand to an object or to himself or herself). 3 = May participate in routine(s) or try to activate an object by vocalizing, banging, or other actions (e.g., bouncing) without looking at another person or vocalizing for help, but does not request, as specified above. 9 = Cannot be rated for some reason other than that listed above, such as if an examiner makes an error and does not administer a particular ADOS activity

Eye contact may be coordinated with pointing and/or vocalization. One clear example of an attempt to draw another person's attention to an object (i.e., more than just referencing) is sufficient for this rating. 1 = Partially references an object that is clearly out of reach.

A participant who uses only a two-point gaze shift AND points or vocalizes should also be coded here. Note that eye gaze coordinated with pointing and/or vocalization are only required for a score of 0 if the participant does not complete the full three-pont gaze shift (i.e., looks at the examiner to the object but does not look back at the examiner OR looks from the object to the examiner, but does not look back at the object). 1 = Looks at the object and then looks at the examiner, but does not look back at the object, vocalize or point OR may spontaneously look at the object, point or vocalize, but does not coordinate either of these with looking at another person. 2 = No approximation of spontaneous joint atention in order to reference an object that is out of reach.

Also assign this rating if the child occasionally integrates eye contact with words/vocalizations or gestures. 2 = Uses primarily one strategy (i.e., eye contact, vocalizations, or gestures) to communicate social intention, without integration. 3 = Rarely uses any clearly communicative strategy to communicate social intention, OR no social overtures. 9 = Cannot be rated for some reason other than that listed above, such as if an examiner makes an error and does not administer a particular ADOS-2 activity.

notes:  0 = Exhibits appropriate integration of eye contact and at least one behavior (e.g., vocalization, gesture, or handing an object to the examiner or the parent/caregiver) to request bubbles, the remote-controlled toy animal, object routine, or social routine, in more than one activity. Must include eye contact and a definite indication of wanting the other person to do or give something (e.g., by persisting in the request ifthe other person pauses before responding). This does not include physically pulling or placing the examiner's hand on an object or to the child himself or herself. 1 = Exhibits behavior described above for code of 0 but occurs in only one activity. 2 = Uses one or more behavior(s) listed above to request the remote-controlled toy animal, bubbles, and/or a routine, without integrating eye contact with other behavior(s), such as vocalization or gesture. This includes handing an object to the examiner or parent/caregiver without looking at him or her and looking at the other person without another behavior. It does not include physically pulling or placing the examiner's hand on an object or to the child himself or herself. Also include clear reaching and briefrequests without persistence in this code. 3 = Does not directly request, as specified above for ratings of 0, 1, or 2. May participate in routine(s) or try to activate an object by undirected vocalizing, or banging without looking at another person or vocalizing for help, but does not request as specified above. May include physically pulling or placing the examiner's hand on an object or to the child himself or herself. 9 = Cannot be rated for some reason other than that listed above, such as if an examiner makes an error and does not administer a particular ADOS-2 activity.

opt:  0;1;2;3;9;-9 
notes:  0 = Uses clearly integrated eye contact to direct another person's attention to an object that is out of reach by looking at the object, then at the examiner or the parent/caregiver, and then back at the object OR by using a three-point gaze shift starting with the examiner or parent/caregiver. Eye contact may be coordinated with pointing and/or vocalization. One clear example is sufficient for this rating. 1 = Looks at an object and then looks at the examiner or the parent/caregiver, but does not look back at the object. 2 = Partially references an object that is clearly out of reach in order to direct another person's attention. May spontaneously look at the object and/or point or vocalize, but does not coordinate either of these with looking at another person. 3 = No approximation of spontaneous initiation of joint attention in order to direct another person's attention to an object that is out of reach. A child who looks at the examiner or parent/caregiver and then at an object, without combining it with other forms of communication (i.e., vocalization or gestures), should be coded here. 9 = Cannot be rated for some reason other than that listed above, such as if an examiner makes an error and does not administer a particular ADOS-2 activity.

The child must follow the examiner's gaze and turn his or her face or eyes in the direction of the target after watching the examiner do so; he or she does not actually have to catch sight of the target. 1 = Follows the examiner's pointing by looking at or toward the target. 2 = Does not follow the examiner's gaze or point to orient toward the object, but looks at the target when activated. 3 = Does not orient to the object even when the object is activated. 9 = Cannot be rated for some reason other than that listed above, such as if an examiner makes an error and does not administer a particular ADOS-2 activity.

The child must follow the examiner's gaze and turn his/her face or eyes in the direction of the target after watching the examiner do so; he/she does not actually have to catch sight of the target. 1 = Responds to the examiner's pointing by looking at or toward the target. 2 = Looks at the target when it is activated or placed directly in front of himlher, but does not make use of the examiner's gaze or pointing in order to locate the target from a distance. 3 = No interest or awareness of the target. If it is not possible to get the child's attention in order to direct it in five attempts, assign this rating.
